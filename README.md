# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on a dataset of housing features using various machine learning regression models. It provides insights into the relationships between house features and their prices while evaluating the performance of different regression techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `House_Price_Pred.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder (optional) to store raw or cleaned datasets if provided separately.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of outliers.
   - Normalization of features for consistent scaling.
   - Handling of missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualization of housing price distributions by location using scatter plots.
   - Advanced visualization techniques with Plotly and Seaborn.

3. **Models Used**:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
   - **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - **Gradient Boosting** (Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor and XGBoost)

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R²) Score

5. **Visualization**:
   - Plotly-based interactive visualizations.
   - Box plots for feature distribution.
   - Comparison of predicted and actual house prices.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as:
- Location details (latitude, longitude).
- House characteristics (size, number of rooms, etc.).
- Target variable: House price.

> Note: The dataset is assumed to be loaded into the notebook directly or provided separately as `data.csv`.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: 2D plotting.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ROBERT-ADDO-ASANTE-DARKO/GO2COD_ML_03.git
   ```
2. Open the `House_Price_Pred.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Install required libraries directly within the notebook using:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn plotly matplotlib
   ```
4. Run all cells sequentially to execute the workflow.

## 📈 Model Performance

| Linear Regression         | 0.31              | 0.62     |
| SVR                       | 0.23              | 0.72     |
| Decision Tree Regressor   | 0.38              | 0.54     |
| Random Forest Regressor   | 0.18              | 0.77     |
| Gradient Boosting         | 0.21              | 0.75     |

## 📌 Highlights
- **Outlier Removal**: Improved dataset quality.
- **Feature Scaling**: Enhanced model convergence.
- **Comparison of Models**: Understanding strengths and weaknesses of different regression techniques.
